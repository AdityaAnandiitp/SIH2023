Smart India Hackathon 2023

This repository contains the reports and solutions that I have created for Smart India Hackathon 2023.
I have created a business model for revolutionizing the Indian wool industry.
The key points of my work are as follows-

– Conceptualized and innovated an app for the USD 1.5 Bn Indian Wool Industry, incorporating real-time market data,
and predictive and AI-driven Analytics for informed decision-making.
– Conducted thorough research on the dynamics of the Indian wool sector, and worked on Supply Chain Optimization.
– Built an intuitive and visually appealing UI, while optimizing UX for seamless navigation and interaction.
– Engaged with government officials and proposed a Go-To-Market strategy (GTM), outlining the transformative impact
of the app-based solution.
